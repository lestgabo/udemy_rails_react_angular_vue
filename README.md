Udemy course - Alpha Blog app of the Rails JavaScript Development course.

- This was built using Ruby on Rails
- for Cloud 9 IDE users, Yarn is not installed but npm is. So to install yarn:

  ```bash
    npm install -g yarn
  
  ```
  "This installs Yarn globally (not just in the node_modules directory in our project folder) so we can simply use the yarn command to use Yarn."
  
  Then you can go ahead and install webpacker and React.
  
  Yarn is our dependency manager for the front-end in our Rails application.
